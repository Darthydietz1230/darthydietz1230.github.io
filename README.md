This project is for North Metro TAFE ICTPRG302 
I have created a wordle-eque game by researching how other people have used certain functions and using them in a way that i was able to.
The scoring on this code works in the way that if:
- a letter is in the secret word and in the correct porition you will see the letter "Y" under the character
- a letter is in the secret word you will see a "?" under the character
- a letter is NOT in the secret word you will see a "-" under the character


I currently have a working code. 
Obviously I am confused on how to use same variables inside/outside of my defined functions which is why it all got lumped into one function
I also am un sure if it will work correctly with words that have two of the same letter in different positions.
I could also improve the game by asking the user if they would like to play again - still researching how to do this. 
happy for all feedback
